# cascading_dropdown_html_example
Cascading dropdown HTML example and reading .txt files from server with Javascript. 

This should work out of the box and contains test files. 

Remember that the files need to be on the server. 
Reading files with Javascript does not work locally using path, it's been disabled for safety reasons by the browser. 
If you want to test locally (without uploading the files to server) you need to setup local test server for testing locally.
