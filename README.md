# cascading_dropdown_html_example
Cascading dropdown menu HTML example and reading .txt files from server with Javascript. 

Try it out:

https://jeesusonherraturku.github.io/test_javascript_txt/

This should work out of the box and contains test files. 


If you download the source and test it, remember that the .txt files need to be on the server. 
Reading files with Javascript does not work locally using path, it's been disabled for safety reasons by the browser. 
If you want to test locally (without uploading the files to server) you need to setup local test server for testing locally.
Here is instruction how to setup local test server:

I also have another page where I use this code, which is for specific purpose(reading Bible). Im slowly adding more chapters to my Bible page.
It also has updated JavaScript code.
